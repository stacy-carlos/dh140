# Data Silence

I found it amazing that through the collection of data one is able to develop Open Street Maps in order to not create opportunities for silence. She discusses how there are often communities missing from mapping due to commercial establishments ignoring them. For a place in Guinea, there were not many details on the location and it was reflected in the maps produced of the area. It was not until the ebola outbreak, and a mapping hub set up, there that area's map was more fleshed out to be an accurate representation of the geography. Lack of movement was also a reason that a community could be missing, for example, and after the Hati earthquake, people's movement to the hillsides is what, quite literally, put those places on the map. This demonstrates had it not been for the availability of data in these areas, there would have been a gap in the data about these places being inhabited and the way they were structured. These locations only became relevant and plentiful in knowledge by the time they were considered worthy of investigation. On a more positive note, the availability of this mapped information allows for the opportunity to plan projects in these areas and even help where needed.
