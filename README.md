 :sparkles: Hello, I'm Stacy! :sparkles:

<h5> 
I am a fourth-year UCLA student pursuing a B.A. in Communication Studies and a minor in Digital Humanities. 
This is my Data Science :computer: project space for the duration of my enrollment in Digital Humanities 104: Coding For Humanities. Some projects I'm thinking about doing are related to gun regulations and related deaths throughout the US. In addition, I am interested in COVID-19 vaccine related impressions and citizen sentiments about them.
