  This week's reading assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that talks about data/information/knowledge/coding that includes some spatial/coding/data science component. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. 
  Then, write a paragraph (yes, a paragraph, not two) that summarizes the article.
  Write a second paragraph where you reflect critically and creatively about the material in your own words. Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? How does it inform you own data science goals?

The instructors will select a few of the readings for discussion in week 2.
