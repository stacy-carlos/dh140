DH and Media Data

I thought the idea that the digital humanities should be researched and implement methods that do not create boundaries of what is worthy of researching and what is not. Although the chapter starts on this rather inspirational note, one should not be under the impression that representation is upheld consistently in this field. The reading, however, does remind one of the powers of social media. Although one is quick to judge the negative of social media, there are so many possibilities with the information and data it has provided, not only to its users, but those who can further knowledge through it. In connection to my point earlier, I cannot help but discuss that there are many who take for granted the availability of social media, especially when we have the opportunity to strike a conversation and protest through it. Those protesting the election in Tehran were not to do what we in the states can because their media is controlled by the state, like in. This only brings to question how can digital humanities effectively promote inclusion in research that uses media data like that of Iran.

Question:On the note of participation without condition, what are your thoughts on how this may relate to the availability of research? The inabilty to some resources given that they are not a part of the free domain and many have to purchase such information.
